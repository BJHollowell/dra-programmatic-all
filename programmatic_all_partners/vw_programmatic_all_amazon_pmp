## description: create partner view for programmatic_all that utilizes raw data and standardizes logic within prog_all
## created by: bj.hollowell@meredith.com

## Last modified by: bj.hollowell@dotdashmdp.com
## Change log:  03/22/22 Removed individual mapping within partner views so it can all be done once in prod version.
##                       Also aggregated the base-level data and cleaned-level data fully to reduce file/processing size(s)
##              08/17/22 update the partner view to incorporate new amazon a9 reports
##              09/13/22 change to amazon data stream data in lieu of custom reporting for 9/1 or later only
##              09/15/22 backfill of data stream for Aug complete, amend to use data stream for 8/1 onward
##              09/21/22 dedupe logic added based on switchboard_processing_time to account for restatement files
##              01/25/23 replace base source data to `about-dss-01`
