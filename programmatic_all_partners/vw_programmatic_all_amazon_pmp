## Last modified by: bj.hollowell@meredith.com
## Change log:  3/22/2022 Removed individual mapping within partner views so it can all be done once in prod version.
##                        Also aggregated the base-level data and cleaned-level data fully to reduce file/processing size(s)
##              8/17/2022 update the partner view to incorporate new amazon a9 reports
##              9/13/2022 change to amazon data stream data in lieu of custom reporting for 9/1 or later only
