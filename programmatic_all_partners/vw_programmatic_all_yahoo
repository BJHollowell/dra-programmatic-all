## Change log:  03/22/22 Removed individual mapping within partner views so it can all be done once in prod version.
##                       Also aggregated the base-level data and cleaned-level data fully to reduce file/processing size(s)
##              01/20/23 Amend base CTEs to account for both Prebid and TAM ingests and union them
##                       Also update cleaned CTE logic to property map new TAM data
