## description: create partner view for programmatic_all that utilizes raw data and standardizes logic within prog_all
## created by: bj.hollowell@meredith.com
## Last modified on: 01/24/23
## Last modified by: bj.hollowell@dotdashmdp.com
## Change log:  03/22/22 Removed individual mapping within partner views so it can all be done once in prod version.
##                       Also aggregated the base-level data and cleaned-level data fully to reduce file/processing size(s)
##              01/24/23 change data source to trustx API from 12/1/22 onward
## notes:
