## description: create partner view for programmatic_all that utilizes raw data and standardizes logic within prog_all
## created by: bj.hollowell@meredith.com
## Last modified on: 3/8/2022
## Last modified by: bj.hollowell@meredith.com
## Change log:  amending the dedupe logic for better efficiency and limiting the fields brought in from raw data.  Second level of dedupe was added
##              as well due to Rogers sending double files most days going all the way back.
##
## notes:
## This view has two different base, cleaned, deduped portions that get unioned into a final output.
## Monthly is 1st then Allrecipes (AR) is below.
